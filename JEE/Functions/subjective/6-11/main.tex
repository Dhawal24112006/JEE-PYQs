\item Let $f$ be a one-one function with domain $\cbrak{x,y,z}$ and range $\cbrak{1,2,3}$. It is given that exactly one of the following statements is true and the remaining two are false ${f\brak{x}=1},{f\brak{y}\neq1},{f\brak{z}\neq2}$ determine $f^{-1}\brak{1}$. \hfill(1981 - 2 Marks)
	\item Let $R$ be the set of real numbers and $f:R \to R$ be such that for all $x$ and $y$ in $R$ ${|f\brak{x}-f\brak{y}| \le |x-y|^3}$ .Prove that $f\brak{x}$ is a constant. \hfill(1988 - 2 Marks)
	\item Find the natural number $'a'$ for which ${\sum\limits_{k=1}^nf\brak{a+k}=16\brak{2^n -1}}$, where the function $'f'$ satisfies the relation ${f\brak{x+y}=f\brak{x}f\brak{y}}$ for all natural numbers $x, y$ and further ${f\brak{1}=2}$. \hfill(1992- 6 Marks)
	\item Let $\cbrak{x}$ and $\sbrak{x}$ denotes the fractional and integral part of a real number $x$ respectively. Solve ${4\cbrak{x}=x+\sbrak{x}}$. \hfill(1994- 4 Marks)
	\item A function $f:IR\to IR$, where $IR$ is the set of real numbers, is defined by ${f\brak{x}=\frac{\alpha x^2 +6x -8}{\alpha +6x-8x^2}}$. Find the interval of values $\alpha$ for which $f$ is onto. Is the function one-to-one for $\alpha=3$? Justify your answer. \hfill(1996- 5 Marks)
	\item Let ${f\brak{x}=Ax^2+Bx+C}$ where $A,B,C$ are real numbers. Prove that if $f\brak{x}$ is an integer whenever $x$ is an integer, then the numbers $2A, A+B$ and $C$ are all integers. Conversly, prove that if the numbers $2A, A+B$ and $C$ are all integers then $f\brak{x}$ is an integer whenever $x$ is an integer. \hfill(1998- 8 Marks)
